#BrickBreaker

Recreation of the game Breakout.
Used object orientated C++ for CSE 165 final project.

Works fairly well but does have a problem with collision between blocks and the ball were in certain cases the ball will phasing through a block and destroy it but, won't change directions and will just keep phasing through blocks till it properly collides with a block and turns around.
